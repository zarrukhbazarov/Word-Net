/**
 *  The DirectedCycle class represents a data type for

 *  The hasCycle operation determines whether the digraph has
 *  a simple directed cycle and, if so, the cycle operation
 *  returns one.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses depth-first search.
 *  The constructor takes θ(V + E) time in the worst
 *  case, where V is the number of vertices and E is
 *  the number of edges.
 *  Each instance method takes θ(1) time.
 *  It uses θ(V) extra space (not including the digraph).
